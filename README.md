# Group Project: Learning-Classifier-for-Cyber-Intrusions-Detection
•	Utilising various feature selection methods and ML classifiers to detect network intrusions using AWID data set. 
•	Designed a ML classifier for detecting various cyber- attacks over WI-FI. 
•	Consisted of code and a report of the major ML steps: data preprocessing, feature selection, algorithm exploration and selection, model refining and analysis of results. 
•	Algorithms used: LDA, PCA, SVC, Extra Trees, MLP.
